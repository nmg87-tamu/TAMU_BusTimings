RouteName - The name of the route 

RouteStopID - A concatenation of the RouteNum and StopNum with an "_" between them, used a way to perform a join to spatial data and associate x, y coordinates with the spreadsheet.

Sheet 2 - SpaceTimeCubeForm


BusTimes - This is the temporal field of the routes, utilize this as the time field in ArcGIS when attempting the STC analysis. If the datatype isn't accepted, create a new field and make it a "time" or "date" datatype and set the calculate the field to equal BusTimes. 

StopClass - What kind of stop is recorded here, Main stops are timed to leave a major point along the route at a specific time whether they arrive early or late. Route stops are only stopped at if a rider requests a stop, or if riders are waiting at the stop location, otherwise they will continue on their route.
